    "In the Philippines, understanding the economic landscape of Filipino families is crucial for policymakers, economists, and social workers alike. The Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), serves as a vital tool in capturing the financial realities of households across the nation. With its extensive data on income, expenditure, and consumption patterns, the FIES serves as a rich resource for understanding the financial dynamics within households across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data from the 2017 FIES survey, our aim is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the annual income of Filipino families based on selected variables. With a dataset encompassing over 40,000 observations and 60 variables, including household income and expenditures, we have a rich source of information to draw upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the kNN regression algorithm, we seek to uncover patterns and relationships within the data that can help predict family incomes more accurately. This predictive model holds the potential to assist policymakers in targeting social welfare programs, economists in understanding income distribution dynamics, and social workers in identifying vulnerable households in need of assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, our project bridges the gap between data and actionable insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions that positively impact Filipino families across the nation. Through the lens of data science, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of the economic realities faced by Filipino households, ultimately striving for a more equitable and prosperous society for all."

    "The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) spearheads the conduct of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) nationwide. The survey, which is undertaken every three (3) years, is aimed at providing data on family income and expenditure, including, among others, levels of consumption by item of expenditure, sources of income in cash, and related information affecting income and expenditure levels and patterns in the Philippines.\n",

    "**Content** <br>\n",
    "Inside this data set is some selected variables from the latest Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) in the Philippines. It contains more than `40k observations and 60 variables` which is primarily comprised of the household income and expenditures of that specific household.\n",

    "The provided evaluation metrics suggest that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the dependent variable, as indicated by the high R-squared value of 0.96. However, the relatively large Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 118879488.31 signifies a considerable average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, suggesting room for improvement in prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 10903.19 implies that, on average, the magnitude of prediction errors is relatively low, despite the high MSE. In summary, while the model demonstrates strong explanatory power, there's potential for enhancing prediction accuracy."
